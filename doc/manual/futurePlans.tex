The future versions of DFT-FE will focus on the implementation of the following methodologies.
\begin{itemize}
\item Hybrid exchange correlation functionals.	
\item Improved electron-density mixing strategies to reduce the number of SCF iterations.
\item Enrichment of the finite-element basis using single atom Kohn-Sham wavefunctions to reduce the computational cost of all-electron DFT calculations.
\end{itemize}
