Developing DFT-FE
=================

There's a lot of things we'd like to do with DFT-FE.  If you want
to get involved, start an issue to discuss new features on
`github <https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe>`_.

All of the following features are under active development at the moment:

  * *A-posteriori* mesh adaption techniques to construct optimal meshes with minimal user intervention.

  * Improved electron-density mixing strategies to reduce the number of SCF iterations.

  * Localization technique to reduce computational complexity of DFT-FE for both metallic and insulating systems in the same framework.

  * Enrichment of the finite-element basis using single atom Kohn-Sham wavefunctions to reduce the computational cost of all-electron DFT calculations.

  * Full GPU support for accelerating the numerical algorithms implemented in DFT-FE.
