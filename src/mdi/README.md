DFT-FE can be interfaced with [MolSSI-MDI](https://github.com/MolSSI-MDI/MDI_Library). The MolSSI Driver Interface (MDI) project provides a standardized API for fast, on-the-fly communication between computational chemistry codes. DFT-FE can be used as a QM engine through MDI and the interface adheres to the [MDI Standard](https://molssi-mdi.github.io/MDI_Library/html/mdi_standard.html). The plugin mode has been tested on both CPUs and Devices. 


Steps to interface MolSSI-MDI with DFT-FE
==========================================

* Install MDI library from [MolSSI-MDI](https://github.com/MolSSI-MDI/MDI_Library).

* Install DFT-FE current development branch (publicGithubDevelop) from [DFT-FE github repo](https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe). The installation instructions for DFT-FE and its dependencies are provied in the development version manual [here](https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe/blob/manual/manual-develop.pdf). To link the dftfe library to MDI set the `mdiPath` variable to the MDI installation path in [setupUser.sh](https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe/blob/publicGithubDevelop/helpers/setupUser.sh) and also set the variable `withMDI` to `ON`. Please note that two separate libdftfe.so files will be created in, one for real datatype (Gamma point) in `yourBuildDir/release/real/` and the other for the complex datatype (multiple k-points) in `yourBuildDir/release/complex/`.


* Create and compile a MDI Driver. Please refer to MDI library documentation for details regarding setup a driver for plugin mode. We also refer to an [example cxx driver](https://github.com/dsambit/MDI_Library/blob/master/driverTestDFTFEPlugin/testcxxplugin/driver_plug_cxx/driver_plug_cxx.cpp) for ground-state QM calculation that has been tested with DFT-FE as the QM engine. This driver is written for the plugin mode.

* MDI create_system in DFT-FE requires for the following mandatory commands: `>CELL, >DIMENSIONS, >NATOMS, >ELEMENTS, >COORDS, >MONKHORST-PACK_NPOINTS >MONKHORST-PACK_SHIFT, >SPIN_POLARIZATION`.

* `>COORDS` must be with respect to origin at the cell corner.

* Before using the interface set `DFTFE_PSP_PATH` environment variable using export to a pseudopotential directory. The pseudpotential directory must contain ONCV format files in the format: *AtomicSymbol.upf*

* Example usage of MDI interfacing with DFT-FE in plugin mode using the [driver](https://github.com/dsambit/MDI_Library/blob/master/driverTestDFTFEPlugin/testcxxplugin/driver_plug_cxx/driver_plug_cxx.cpp):
(using NERSC Cori interactive job)
```
srun -n 256 -c 4 --cpu-bind=cores ./driver_plug_cxx -driver_nranks 0 -plugin_nranks 256 -plugin_name "dftfe" -mdi "-role DRIVER -name driver -method LINK -plugin_path /global/project/projectdirs/m2360/softwaresDFTFE/intel19knl/dftfemdi/build/release/complex" > driveroutput
```
Please note that plugin_path above points to the location of libdftfe.so.

* DFT-FE's MDI interface currently only sets up GGA PBE ground-state DFT calculations using ONCV pseudopotentials (http://www.pseudo-dojo.org for example) on either CPU only or hybrid CPU-Device architecture. Fermi-dirac smearing with 500 K smearing temperature is used by default.

* **CAUTION**: Due to the nature of the electrostatics formulation implemented in DFT-FE we strongly recommend to tile periodic cell lengths so that they are more than 10 atomic units
