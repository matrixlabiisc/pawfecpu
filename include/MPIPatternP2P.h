       * + <b>Assumptions</b>
       *    1. It assumes that a a sparse communication pattern. That is,
       *       a given processor only communicates with a few processors.
       *       This object should be avoided if the communication pattern
       *       is dense (e.g., all-to-all communication)
       *    2. It assumes that the each processor owns a set of \em continuous
       *       integers (indices). Further, the ownership is exclusive (i.e.,
       *       no index is owned by more than one processor). In other words,
       *       the different sets of owning indices across all the processors
       *       are disjoint.
       *
       * @tparam memorySpace Defines the MemorySpace (i.e., HOST or
       * DEVICE) in which the various data members of this object must reside.
