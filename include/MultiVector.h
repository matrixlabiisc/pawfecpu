     * @brief An class template to encapsulate a MultiVector.
     * A MultiVector is a collection of \f$N\f$ vectors belonging to the same
     * finite-dimensional vector space, where usual notion of vector size
     * denotes the dimension of the vector space. Note that this in the
     * mathematical sense and not in the sense of an multi-dimensional array.The
     * MultiVector is stored contiguously with the vector index being the
     * fastest index, or in other words a matrix of size \f$M \times N\f$ in row
     * major format with \f$M \f$ denoting the dimension of the vector space
     * (size of individual vector).
     *
     * This class handles both serial and distributed MultiVector
     * in a unfied way. There are different constructors provided for the
     * serial and distributed case.
     *
     * The serial MultiVector, as the name suggests, resides entirely in a
     * processor.
     *
     * The distributed MultiVector, on the other hand, is distributed across a
     * set of processors. The storage of each of the \f$N\f$ vectors in the
     * distributed MultiVector in a processor follows along similar lines to
     * a distributed Vector object and comprises of two parts:
     *   1. <b>locally owned part</b>: A part of the distribute MultiVector,
     * defined through a contiguous range of indices \f$[a,b)\f$ (\f$a\f$ is
     * included, but \f$b\f$ is not), for which the current processor is the
     * sole owner. The size of the locally owned part (i.e., \f$b-a\f$) is
     * termed as \e locallyOwnedSize. Note that the range of indices that
     * comprises the locally owned part (i.e., \f$[a,b)\f$) is same for all the
     * \f$N\f$ vectors in the MultiVector
     *   2. <b>ghost part</b>: Part of the MultiVector, defined
     *      through a set of ghost indices, that are owned by other processors.
     * The size of ghost indices for each vector is termed as \e ghostSize. Note
     * that the set of indices that define the ghost indices are same for all
     * the \f$N\f$ vectors in the MultiVector
     *
     * The global size of each vector in the distributed MultiVector
     * (i.e., the number of unique indices across all the processors) is simply
     * termed as \e size. Additionally, we define \e localSize = \e
     * locallyOwnedSize + \e ghostSize.
     *
     * We handle the serial MultiVector as a special case of the distributed
     * MultiVector, wherein \e size = \e locallyOwnedSize and \e ghostSize = 0.
     *
     * @note While typically one would link to an MPI library while compiling this class,
     * care is taken to seamlessly allow usage of this class even while not
     * linking to an MPI library. To do so, we have our own MPI wrappers that
     * redirect to the MPI library's function calls and definitions while
     * linking to an MPI library. While not linking to an MPI library, the MPI
     * wrappers provide equivalent functions and definitions that mimic the MPI
     * functions and definitions, albeit for a single processor. This allows the
     * user of this class to seamlessly switch between linking and de-linking to
     * an MPI library without any change in the code and with the expected
     * behavior.
     *
     * @note Note that the case of not linking to an MPI library and the case of
     * creating a serial mult-Vector are two independent things. One can still
     * create a serial MultiVector while linking to an MPI library and
     * running the code across multipe processors. That is, one can create a
     * serial MultiVector in one or more than one of the set of processors used
     * when running in parallel. Internally, we handle this by using
     * MPI_COMM_SELF as our MPI_Comm for the serial MultiVector (i.e., the
     * processor does self communication). However, while not linking to an MPI
     * library (which by definition means running on a single processor), there
     * is no notion of communication (neither with self nor with other
     * processors). In such case, both serial and distributed mult-Vector mean
     * the same thing and the MPI wrappers ensure the expected behavior (i.e.,
     * the behavior of a MultiVector while using just one processor)
     *
     * @tparam template parameter ValueType defines underlying datatype being stored
     *  in the MultiVector (i.e., int, double, complex<double>, etc.)
     * @tparam template parameter memorySpace defines the MemorySpace (i.e., HOST or
     * DEVICE) in which the MultiVector must reside.
     *
     * @note Broadly, there are two ways of constructing a distributed MultiVector.
     *  1. [<b>Prefered and efficient approach</b>] The first approach takes a
     *     pointer to an MPIPatternP2P as an input argument (along with other
     * arguments). The MPIPatternP2P, in turn, contains all the information
     *     regarding the locally owned and ghost part of the MultiVector as well
     * as the interaction map between processors. This is the most efficient way
     * of constructing a distributed MultiVector as it allows for reusing of an
     *     already constructed MPIPatternP2P.
     *  2. [<b> Expensive approach</b>] The second approach takes in the
     *     locally owned, ghost indices or the total number of indices
     *     across all the processors and internally creates an
     *     MPIPatternP2P object. Given that the creation of an MPIPatternP2P is
     *     expensive, this route of constructing a distributed MultiVector
     *     <b>should</b> be avoided.
